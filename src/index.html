			<h2><span>Colouring Cats</span> are an indie-rock quartet based in Melbourne.</h2>
			<div class="bandBio">
				<p>Displaying the contempt for word-limits one might expect from a band taking its name from a David Foster Wallace essay, the group draws on careful arrangements, energetic delivery and a rock and roll aesthetic to deliver songs that move forward with intensity and emotional range.</p>
				<p>Combining a contraminimalist philosophy with a sharply-honed rhythm section, loose vocals, and dirty guitar - its members have developed a body of work that feels deliberate and considered, yet constantly at risk of falling apart.</p>

					<p>It’s all transient connections crowded bookstores and the promise of love</p>

					<p>It’s the loneliness, long hours, and the constant threat of lining up</p>

					<p>And you can live out with the gunshots;<br>
					You can bartend on the weekends</p>

					<p>But there’s a weight upon your shoulders<br>
					Because at some point they will raise the rent</p>

					<p>And I’m talking to the man with the horn-rimmed glasses<br>
					He’s threatening to leave because they only ever promise spring</p>

					<p>And I’m waiting for a train and now it’s almost been an hour<br>
					I’m trying to find a place to stand that smells a tiny bit less awful than this</p>

					<p>It’s all transplants and migration<br>
					And the natives aren’t just holding their tongues<br>
					Now Spike Lee is on his high-horse
					‘bout how whitey just keeps fucking it up</p>

					<p>And there’s a sense of hesitation<br>
					As a beautiful voice echoes my way<br>
					Keep the performance at a distance<br>
					I don’t want to feel obliged to pay</p>

					<p>Now a scream from down the hall's become white noise, just like the traffic<br>
					I hear it with my ears, I guess, but not enough to make me think</p>

					<p>If someone pauses for a second on the left side of the sidewalk<br>
					It’s all that I can do to stop myself from throwing out some limb</p>

					<p>I was led to believe that this place never ever would sleep<br>
					Yet come four AM it’s last call <br>
					And the people pour onto the streets</p>

					<p>And I know it’s a fiction<br>
					I know it’s just glass and concrete<br>
					But I thought that numerical grid might mean something for me</p>

					<p>It’s a feeling in your stomach that you’re not sure why you’re waking up<br>
					Not like you’re all that money hungry<br> 
					But the bills they just keep piling up</p>

					<p>You suspect things might have changed
					since CBGB’s closed their doors to punk<br>
					All the children - so well spoken<br>
					All the strollers parked in bars and pubs</p>

					<p>But there’s something ‘bout the snow
					when it falls over the city<br>
					It belies the cold I feel<br>
					Makes me believe that there’s something that I’ve missed</p>

					<p>There’s something ‘bout the pain
					that makes not quitting seem a victory<br> 
					Drop our standards down so low that 
					we’re just happy if the beating’s swift</p>

					<p>I was led to believe<br>
					That this land was the land of the free</p> 

					<p>But when most of the kitchen
					are paid in slave wages<br>
					It’s hard to agree</p>

					<p>And I know that it’s nice to eat cheap<br>
					To drink almost for free<br>
					But this empire would fall if they opened the curtain on what’s underneath</p>

					<p>This empire would fall if they opened the curtain on what’s underneath<br>
					This empire would fall if they opened the curtain on what’s underneath</p>

					<p>Ships arrive at the harbour<br>
					Town rushes out<br>
					And lost amongst the fray<br>
					is an eight year old<br>
					with a glowing face</p>

					<p>Off the ship<br>
					steps the captain<br>
					foreign sun has made his skin so brown<br>
					And spillin' from his lips<br>
					tales of sunkissed hips<br>
					And the way they swayed<br>
					and of glory's rays</p>

					<p>And though they'd have loved to make their way round<br>
					well there was just no way<br>
					But they didn't have god on their side - did they?</p>

					<p>Sixteen years of age<br>
					all bones and wire<br>
					And hands that could sand (or grind) back stone<br>
					He’s watched the hammer hit the steel<br>
					Ten thousand times, eyes peeled<br>
					The smith said still said no<br>
					There was much more to know</p>

					<p>So in the company of a warship<br>
					He would make his name<br>
					But how could that be enough when there were still paths<br>
					To claim</p> 
					 
					<p>If we make it past the coast then we’ll all be fine<br>
					Saffron and cinnamon would change our lives</p>

					<p>What’s sweeter than gold would be some new trade lines<br>
					To set that red flag against the eastern  sky<br>
					There must be some way to those scented isles</p>


					<p>The months go by<br>
					And they cling to life<br>
					As they run short of all supplies<br>
					Till they come across a land<br>
					And a well-staffed clan<br>
					That spoke the tongue of his slave<br>
					And a pact was made</p>

					<p>Their leader was stricken by some dark curse and if he could be saved<br>
					They'd join them and help them load their ships up<br>
					With sage</p>

					<p>If you throw away those idylls<br>
					You’ll be half way to recovering’<br> 
					You’ve been worshipping a false god<br>
					The true one’s let you suffer<br>
					‘Cause the fact is - well, let’s face it, look at my ships look at yours<br>
					Who’s doing better, who’s come further, who’s more capable of war?</p>

					<p>I don’t expect that you’ll believe me<br>
					I don’t mean no disrespect<br>
					Let’s make a deal<br>
					Let’s make this real<br>
					Let’s add some substance to this bet</p> 

					<p>If you don’t make it your men here can take my head<br>
					I’ll stay with them<br>
					and I’ll leave mine out by the port<br>
					So there’s no way they can avenge</p>

					<p>Let’s just believe<br>
					In something real</p>

					<p>Feverish and pale<br>
					With his eyes so wild<br>
					He screams<br>
					and pleads<br>
					but then it all subsides</p>

					<p>Thankful as he is<br>
					to resist hell’s fire<br>
					He calls over his men and locates his guides</p>

					<p>They take their new friend<br>
					to his scented isles</p>

					<p>That he seems so fond of<br>
					What better place to die?</p>

					<h3>Ships Depart</h3>

					<p>Say my goodbyes<br>
					Check all the locks<br>
					Last walk around<br>
					Last kiss to the ground</p>

					<p>Sweet Earth, its scent<br>
					Rolls into my lungs<br>
					Gripping me down<br>
					Says not to go on<br>
					Without it</p>

					<p>In circles around<br>
					This place where I walk<br>
					Before I felt fear<br>
					Now I sincerely hope<br>
					I'm right in choosing no god</p>

					<p>Believe that there<br>
					Is no greater cause<br>
					Than to discover</p>

					<p>Ship changes course<br>
					Towards the abyss<br>
					That starry collapse<br>
					My god, this is it<br>
					Don't go</p>

					<p>Engine turns off<br>
					Lights start to dim<br>
					Ship loses form<br>
					And starts to spin<br>
					Vision's a blur<br>
					Of white, then it's gone</p>

					<p>Feeling its pull<br>
					I ready my brow<br>
					Prepare my brave face<br>
					For the speed of sound<br>
					Tighten my straps<br>
					Breathe in and hold on</p>

					<p>Feeling my pulse<br>
					In the absence of time<br>
					Your brain won't slow down<br>
					Like they said it might<br>
					Everything else<br>
					Slows down to a halt</p>

					<p>And then it begins to turn back.</p>

					<h3>The Peacock</h3>
					<p>It’s dark<br>
					And there’s music playing<br>
					She sits at the bar<br>
					All alone</p>

					<p>A drink<br>
					Arrives<br>
					It’s from the man<br>
					All the way up in the back<br>
					In the suit with the flower in his hat</p>

					<p>Does he catch your eye at all? <br>
					He’s got his own thing going on<br>
					Do you like his power stance?<br>
					Has he hypnotised you with his love-trance?</p>

					<p>You say no thanks<br>
					Send it back<br>
					He just shrugs<br>
					And when the bartender brings it his way<br>
					He just scouts for a new candidate </p>

					<p>Friends have left<br>
					or paired up<br>
					He was there<br>
					And sometimes that’s all that it takes<br>
					So won’t you please let him be your mistake? </p>

					<p>Picks his feathers out then glues them on<br>
					It's all just for you<br>
					He's hoping you'll see</p>

					<p>He's well dressed and oozing with charm<br>
					He's practiced getting his hand<br>
					From his knee to your arm</p>

					<p>Because he knows that's how things start</p>

					<p>He's white teeth<br>
					pre-torn jeans<br>
					Silken shirts<br>
					Soft-soled shoes that might only last weeks<br>
					But let him moonwalk, should the DJ accede</p>

					<p>Often struts<br>
					Sometimes sweet<br>
					If he’s mean<br>
					He’s just banking on low self-esteem<br>
					That you’ll engage,<br>
					To try to sway his beliefs</p>

					<p>Oh, does he seem a little strange<br>
					Not self-assured, but somehow still<br>
					self-conscious and vain<br>
					You should know you’re not his aim<br>
					Because it’s all a numbers game</p>

					<p>Picks his feathers out then glues them on<br>
					It’s not just for you <br>
					He needs to be seen</p>

					<p>He’s well dressed and oozing with charm<br>
					Never goes to a club<br>
					Where they don’t play his song<br>
					It's all just for you<br>
					He needs you to see</p>

					<p>Because he knows that's how things start<br>
					He's been told that's how things start</p>

					<p>Another night<br>
					Another bar<br>
					Another him<br>
					Another notch to confirm he can charm</p>

					<p>But he weeps<br>
					In the night<br>
					Doesn’t leave <br>
					Unless he’s go some grand design</p>

					<h3>Song for Steve Jobs</h3>

					<p>They said you were the prophet of our age<br>
					You did little to dispel the myth<br>
					They clamoured at the gates when you had died<br>
					For evidence of some much larger gift</p>

					<p>You must have given, given something<br> 
					Oh that could not be all that you did<br>
					Of course you must be<br>
					So humble all the evidence was hid</p>

					<p>Dropping from the square of those old buildings<br>
					Oh you struggle from the bottom to the top<br>
					Sleeping on the floor of their apartments<br>
					It's all the reason that we need to<br> 
					Feature you, give you the lead in our hearts<br>
					All the angles that your story hit us hard<br>
					That could be us! Plucked up out from the rubble to take charge</p>

					<p>They claimed that you were a visionary<br> 
					For your rebellion to that styleless regime<br>
					When they wore grey you wore a stunning silver<br>
					When they wore frills you stayed trimmed at the seams,<br> 
					But sewed them in on such an angle<br>
					Oh taste was at the heart of what you did<br>
					No gaudy typeface would mar the surface of your latest trick</p>

					<p>When you stood down there was the greatest whispering<br>
					Yet there were few that would accept that you could bleed<br>
					Some screamed as the price of stocks went diving<br>
					Some merely feared their idol could recede<br> 
					To that place that we must all end up<br>
					That money can't save us, at least not yet<br>
					On my headstone, let my epitaph be written in Helvetica</p>

					<p>Working in the din in little factories<br>
					Where leaked secrets collect the greatest tolls<br>
					Not business as usual on the surface<br>
					But underneath the covers where the contracts are for service<br>
					It's your standard arrangement - ship offshore and then forget<br>
					And yes, they all do, but you purported to stand out from the rest</p>

					<p>I'm sure they will name streets and they'll build statues<br> 
					With your neck protected well from the cold<br>
					Like Carnegie you'll be remembered as a captain<br>
					But the lesson that he learned<br> 
					Was to acquire then disburse<br> 
					And it's the latter that really gives your living any point</p>

					<p>You're this decade's Lennon<br>
					And just like him you did not fail to disappoint<br>
					Not what I'd expected<br> 
					When you built your reputation<br> 
					Ostensibly objecting to the things that we'd accepted</p> 

					<p>Don't know why<br>
					I find I'm so offended<br>
					At the time-frame for which you'll be remembered</p>

					<p>I don't like to speak ill of the dead<br>
					But all you did was make some things<br>
					And yeah, you probably pushed it forward <br>
					A few years but so what?</p>

					<p>Strip all meaning from the term 
					'revolution'<br> 
					Let it pass to the vernacular of neo-liberal-market-worshippers<br>
					Let's pretend minimalism did not exist before you<br>
					Aggressively assert your rights to make sure it does not become the norm</p>

					<p>You're not the fucking Che Guevera of the modern day<br>
					You're smart, you took some risks, but only dented the existing paradigm.</p>
